Want nothing, need nothing, feel nothing. In this singular moment you are grey, lukewarm, half-awake. Words are but letters arranged in order, seen but not understood.

Savor this soft feeling. In time it will pass, and you will wake slowly or drift off to sleep, but during this gentle in-between, do not consider what is or what may be.

If you must be, then be grey, be formless, be neither here nor there. For there is a time to be there, and a time to be here, but it is not this time. Not here, not now, not in the grey.
