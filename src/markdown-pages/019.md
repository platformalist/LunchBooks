title: "An Ocean Without Water"
---

Another wave crashes against the beachfront, dampening my feet. I've stood on the shore for as long as I can remember, waiting for the water to recede. But it never will.

I hate the sea, and what it makes me. It rushes forth and pulls away, but only so far in either direction. It is everpresent, a reality from which I stand no chance of escape.

But what is an ocean without water? A wasteland of high craters, vast plains, broken fissures. An empty place, devoid of vibrancy. The water chills me, hinders me, threatens to drag me into the open space and drown me in its depths, but this is no reason to resent it. The water has no mind. The sea is a fact, not an option.

The water is here. And I must discover what I'm to make of it.
