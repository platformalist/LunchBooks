title: "In Search of Brittle Leaves"

She came to this place as she did every year, in search of brittle leaves and decomposing branches. Spring had risen, summer had blossomed, and autumn had come to rest, but there was not one fallen leaf on the forest floor.

Instead, she found clusters of wood and stone with tilted tops, and great apes, bustling about with their offspring. She found no soft ground to tread upon, no tall grass to eat, no warm trees for shelter. And so, she wandered amidst flying metal boxes and harsh yellow lights, until she found her way back to the humble forest she loved, tucked on a steep, forgotten ridge.

Her world was as large as ever, but it was changing.
