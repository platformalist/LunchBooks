title: "A Being is Born Into Space"
---

A Being is born into Space. It hovers, a warm light in a cold, harsh vacuum. It is intelligent, beautiful to behold, a ball of pure energy rippling electrons into the ether. The Space grasps at it with icy fingers, eager to bend the living dream to its will.

The Being does not know of its insubordination to the stillness. It is new, too new to understand the patterns acting upon it, the violence perpetrated by the Space. To the Being, these actions are but moments, flickers in time, things which are and always were, without a doubt. The Being is as powerful as it must be, an equal and opposite reaction to the gravity which holds it down, the winds which rip at its essence, the corrupted cells which threaten to collapse it from within.

Being is the refusal of Not-Being. Insistence and noncompliance born of an innate will to survive, thrive, glow, and be known in an empty place.
