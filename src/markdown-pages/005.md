title: "Nature's Heart"
---

In moments of frustration or helplessness, I seek solace in communion with nature. But how can I ever express my gratitude?

How can I thank her for the time spent in my lover's arms under an old tree? Or moments running barefoot through the grass on a long summer's day? Or lazy afternoons, impressing my own understanding onto perfect shapes presented in the sky? Would that I could tell her what she means to me. She gives so much, and I, so little.

I dream that the moon is nature's heart. And by loving it, I can love her.
