title: "That Nature Knowledge"

Breathe the last moment of a season, become cold and still for a time, then be reborn on the other side. Living stasis, immutable for a time, yet easily fallen with an electrical shock, the whirling of metal jags, too much or too little light. Powerful yet frail, long-and-short-lived.

Your fingers are far-reaching, strong with intent to hold, sipping lifeblood in symbiosis with the Earth. Hold still the ground and feed the world above, while the ever-present weight below nourishes you.

Your veins hang loose in the air, eager to consume and convert, to breathe what you’ve received back into the world, ever-willing to take what is given and, if not given enough, gently fade away. A natural intuition forgotten by my own kind: this knowledge of life and death, creation and conversion, the acknowledgement of one’s own longevity and defined term, expressed and experienced without complaint, fear, anger, or sorrow.

That joy of being, that precious creative instinct, that nature knowledge.
