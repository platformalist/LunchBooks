title: "Fog on the Window"

Droplets form on a pane of glass. Cold, soft, silklike, intricately woven by subtle temperature changes, moisture procured from the air by energy transfers through a solid object. Outer worlds affect formation, growth, changes on the inside.

Condemnation and fear arise from my side of the window, forming gently on my perception of you, born from our differences. These realizations congeal on the place where I assess and understand the world outside. Once, I could see out this window, but it’s nearly white, washed over by the fog.

If we were the same, would I be able to see you? Or will there always be distance between us?
