title: "A Warm, Soft Weight"

A warm, soft weight. Loving, frightened, curled up small.

You trust me to hold you, and I trust you to hold my thumbs, to accept me for who I am, just as I accept you as a new presence in my life. A presence arrived at the right time, in the right place, to sit on my belly and stare into my eyes.

Two beings, together. A coolness and a warmth, a plant and a seed, a cloud and a raindrop.

I yearn to not forget how it felt when you came to me, a dream dreaming of itself, gasping for breath as you surfaced, finally in control, finally free.
