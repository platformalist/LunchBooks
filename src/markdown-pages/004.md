While editing, "I ate lunch" can become "I ate a sandwich", or "I scarfed down a hearty sandwich". Things can be taken too far, of couse. "I hungrily scarfed down the discount reuben-on-rye sandwich, which had been packed for me earlier that day by my dear, sweet grandmother".

While overblown, the latter sentence might work in some contexts. For instance, the first sentence in a short story can--on occasion--be a little over-diligent with descriptors. These moments of imagery can set the story's pace and familiarize readers with the world you've chosen to mold. Who knows? Maybe the aforementioned reuben sandwich has an important role to play in the story! But if we're halfway through a novel and keeping the pace up during an action sequence, sometimes it's best to keep things simple. "I grabbed a bite to eat, then rushed out the door" should suffice in this context.

Long story short, or short story long, the scale of your editing is ultimately up to you. You, the author, the mastermind with the pen, the one holding ultimate power over imaginary beings of your own creation! There are suitable answers to subjective editing predicaments, and it's essential to assess the voice and pace you'd like to capture, if you're to come out of this editing process on top. Good luck!
