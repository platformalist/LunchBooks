I rarely do my best thinking while running to the bus, or sitting on my phone, or speaking with a friend. Inner monologue thrives in quiet moments. Considering the amount of monologue in character-driven novels, moments of silence are vital.

A ticking clock in the middle of the night. The creaking of frogs on a lonely pathway. The dusting of rain on grass in the early morning. When a soft breeze is loud enough to speak to you, when you can hear a bumblebee across a football stadium, when knots untie and you finally see things with clarity like never before. I'd like to chase these feelings, to capture what they could mean to a character, and explore what these moments might bring out in them.
