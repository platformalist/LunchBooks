Churn. Vibrate with urgency, rush, flush with energy and power. Collide, bounce and rebound, tear at your form, the form you’ve known, your once-indestructible bonds now divided, atomic. Grow thin, thin, thin, until your bonds, all at once, break.

Evaporate. Transition, yet maintain similitude. You are the flip of a falling leaf, the moment before stepping into a puddle, the first breath of cold on a winter’s day.

Disperse. Lose your form, accept your future, burst with potential. Spread on the winds, no longer trapped by strands or glass or metal. See, hear, feel, dive and twirl, climb high, precipitate. You are the true love of life itself, sweet to the lips, soft to the touch, a dream to behold.
