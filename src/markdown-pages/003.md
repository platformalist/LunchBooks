title: "Too Much Veneer"
---

I'm editing a scene in which Lonai and Somai are making stew in their kitchen before the adventure kicks off. Lonai munches on a carrot from the countertop, and they share their feelings about what's going on in the plot. I wish that they could stay in the kitchen forever. But the plot's about to take off, and even though they're fictional, I feel for them. I want them to be happy.

Why do we, as authors, need to inflict the uncertainty of change on our characters? I believe that it's our job to create worlds in which our readers can lose themselves. And if things are too flat, too stagnant, too perfect, the story loses its believability. Reality is comprised of a multitude of imperfections, and too much veneer kills the illusion.

Life isn't smooth. Life isn't safe. Life isn't expected. And we owe it to our characters to inject their lives with the joy and fear that only comes with plunging headfirst into the unknown.
