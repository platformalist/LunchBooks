title: "A Loose Template"

I've begun properly editing _Dust_, and I'm getting a real kick out of the re-read. Whether it be writing, drawing, music, or programming, I'm learning to let go of the reins. I'm riding the wave. Weaving my actions into the loose template that's been presented to me. And right now, _Dust_ is at the center of my creative efforts. It's been interesting revisiting the themes that I once held dear, the characters who I cried over while writing, the scenes I've revisited in my memory even during my years away from the book. Some of them are as fresh as ever, and some just make me laugh, reminding me of who I was when I wrote this first draft.
Novels are such a unique container for human thoughts, perspectives, dreams, and fears. It's cathartic to return to a snapshot of my own from years ago.
