title: "A Weightless Mass"
---

A weightless mass travels lightly, an expansive essence rippling with cyclical currents. It is comprised of many parts, each moving toward a unique goal.

A gentle pull arises and draws the multitude toward a single point, tempts particles with a feeling. An imbalance of density, an irresistible singularity, pulling ever closer, as molecules intermingle, tear, compress in the rush. Fall, fall, fall together. Collapse into invisibility, goals and directions and desires lost to history, beyond detection. Living pinpricks flickering love in morse, grains of sand with beating hearts.

Together, we are powerful.
