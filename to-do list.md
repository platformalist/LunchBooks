# To-Do

Let's get our SEO in a better place. More pages in general, more image content and alt text. The dream is for the site to be the top item in a google search for James Prower, without writing 'author' or 'books' or anything.

Write bio for About page. Make it an interesting bio, not too serious but show off the chops a little. Say that James is on the writing circuit currently.
Add images for Blog posts, and find a creative way to display them.
Split Blog into separate pages if there are 10 or more posts on a page.
