# To-Do

Blog

Add images for Blog posts, and have them sit on the right-hand side in a separate column, in a square. Use alt text.
Figure out an organization structure so people can click through them.
Maybe a word count next to the name.
Make sure the name James Prower comes through in SEO for every blog post, and that we have unique SEO for each.
Remove full blog page, instead link to newest blog post

Add a link resolver - all links using 'a' tags right now which seems like a terrible idea. Should use gatsby-link.

Fix the spacing on the main page when on mobile. The book cover sits left-aligned but should be centered. Give each page a mobile pass. Headers also look kinda meh.

General
Migrate Bio and Novel summary to Kobo, Kindle and Nook pages, to fill out gap in content. Also, maybe get ABoSCI on a freebie sale sometime here.
