# To-Do

Blog
Split Blog into separate pages.
Add images for Blog posts, and have them sit on the right-hand side in a separate column, in a square. Use alt text.
Figure out an organization structure so people can click through them. Maybe a word count next to the name.
Make sure the name James Prower comes through in SEO for every blog post, and that we have unique SEO for each.

General
Migrate Bio and Novel summary to Kobo, Kindle and Nook pages, to fill out gap in content. Also, maybe get ABoSCI on a freebie sale sometime here.
