# To-Do

Ensure that Home, About, and Blog all use a similar heading sizing hierarchy. They're too varied right now.
Use a nice soft white for the background. Too harsh right now.
Make sure all text uses grey.

Header
Fix navbar underlining - doesn't work when live. Maybe need a state on each nav object so when it's clicked it gets underlined
Header BG - same issue with states - needs to update depending on page

Blog
Split Blog into separate pages.
Add images for Blog posts, and feed them through into the header so you get a different texture for every blog post.
Figure out an organization structure so people can click through them. Maybe a word count next to the name.
Make sure the name James Prower comes through in SEO for every blog post, and that we have unique SEO for each.
