# To-Do

Blog

Fix the spacing on the main page when on mobile. The book cover sits left-aligned but should be centered. Give each page a mobile pass. Headers also look kinda meh.

Improve SEO on each page. Maybe have an excerpt on blog posts instead of just using generic text. Make sure James Prower name is in all the SEO though.
Migrate Bio and Novel summary to Kobo, Kindle and Nook pages, to fill out gap in content. Also, maybe get ABoSCI on a freebie sale sometime here.

Once I have 500 followers
Build an optional navbar to appear on the right side with a word count next to the name, but keep it commented out until there are more posts.
Add images for Blog posts, and have them sit on the right-hand side in a separate column, in a square. Use alt text.
Do a full Twitter purge of people who look meh who didn't follow me back.
