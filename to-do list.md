# To-Do

Migrate Bio and Novel summary to Kobo, Kindle and Nook pages, to fill out gap in content. Get ABoSCI on a freebie sale sometime here.

Once I have 500 followers
Build a navbar to appear on the right side with a word count next to the name of the article. Vanishes at small sizes.
Add images for Blog posts, maybe have them sit on the right-hand side in a separate column, in a square. Use alt text.
Do a full Twitter purge of people who look meh who didn't follow me back.
