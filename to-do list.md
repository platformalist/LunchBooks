# To-Do

Ensure that Home, About, and Blog all use a similar heading sizing hierarchy. They're too varied right now.
Use a nice soft white for the background. Too harsh right now.
Make sure all text uses grey.

Home
Fix grid to match about page. Rethink how book displays - should we do a column with a big version of the book? Or a nice big circle with the book inside?
Maybe add a shadow like kobo does - on the query might look alright

Split Blog into separate pages.
Add images for Blog posts, and feed them through into the header so you get a different texture for every blog post.
Figure out an organization structure so people can click through them. Maybe a word count next to the name.
Make sure the name James Prower comes through in SEO for every blog post, and that we have unique SEO for each.

Fix JP heading so it's not so sloppy when scaling down. Scale it much smaller much sooner, and keep it left-aligned the whole way down.
Write improved synopsis for ABOSCI that isn't so vague. End it with the current bio, but add some text saying what actually happens.

Do a full mobile pass.
