# To-Do

Blog

Fix the spacing on the main page when on mobile. The book cover sits left-aligned but should be centered. Give each page a mobile pass. Headers also look kinda meh.
Add a link resolver and swap links site-wide - all links using 'a' tags right now which seems like a terrible idea. Should use gatsby-link.

Add images for Blog posts, and have them sit on the right-hand side in a separate column, in a square. Use alt text.
Improve SEO on each page. Maybe have an excerpt on blog posts instead of just using generic text. Make sure James Prower name is in all the SEO though.
Build an optional navbar to appear on the right side with a word count next to the name, but keep it commented out until there are more posts.
Migrate Bio and Novel summary to Kobo, Kindle and Nook pages, to fill out gap in content. Also, maybe get ABoSCI on a freebie sale sometime here.
