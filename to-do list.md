# To-Do

Blog

Header text sits weird when it gets small.
Fonts should be set as one size then scale as the screen shrinks, not have to be manually set.

Let's take tabs of the sizes we're working with here.

Banner Header: Starts at 900, scales down to 700. [900,800,700]

Main Header - top item on all pages. size 700, no scaling. [700]

Button - size 400, no scaling. [400]

James Prower text at bottom. - size 400, no scaling [700]

Improve SEO on each page. Maybe have an excerpt on blog posts instead of just using generic text. Make sure James Prower name is in all the SEO though.
Migrate Bio and Novel summary to Kobo, Kindle and Nook pages, to fill out gap in content. Also, maybe get ABoSCI on a freebie sale sometime here.

Once I have 500 followers
Build an optional navbar to appear on the right side with a word count next to the name, but keep it commented out until there are more posts.
Add images for Blog posts, and have them sit on the right-hand side in a separate column, in a square. Use alt text.
Do a full Twitter purge of people who look meh who didn't follow me back.
