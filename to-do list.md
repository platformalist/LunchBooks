# To-Do

Let's get our SEO in a better place. More pages in general, more image content and alt text. The dream is for the site to be the top item in a google search for James Prower, without writing 'author' or 'books' or anything.

Ensure that Home, About, and Blog all use a similar heading sizing hierarchy. They're too varied right now.
Use a nice soft white for the background. Too harsh right now.
Make sure all text uses grey.

Home
Make book title span entire block instead of being off to the right.
Fix grid to match about page.

About
Add image that looks more like a headshot or a bio pic. Doesn't have to be too personal, just something more write-y.
Add a header to the bio

Split Blog into separate pages.
Add images for Blog posts, and find a creative way to display them.
Figure out an organization structure so people can click through them. Maybe a word count next to the name.

Do a full mobile pass.
