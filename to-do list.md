# To-Do

Let's get our SEO in a better place. More pages in general, more image content and alt text. The dream is for the site to be the top item in a google search for James Prower, without writing 'author' or 'books' or anything.

Create a Bio page, or About the Author, or something like that. Do a photo.
Add optional images for Blog page.
Rename Blog as Scribblings. or something more charming. And have it split off into separate pages if there are 10 or more posts on a page.
Investigate other author pages and see what small stuff we can borrow.
